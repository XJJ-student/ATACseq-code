<h3>Details</h3>

<p>These functions provide convenient wrappers around <code><a href="../../csaw/help/combineTests.html">combineTests</a></code>, <code><a href="../../csaw/help/getBestTest.html">getBestTest</a></code>, 
<code><a href="../../csaw/help/empiricalFDR.html">empiricalFDR</a></code>, <code><a href="../../csaw/help/mixedClusters.html">mixedClusters</a></code> and <code><a href="../../csaw/help/upweightSummit.html">upweightSummit</a></code> 
for handling overlaps between windows and arbitrary pre-specified regions.
They accept <a href="../../S4Vectors/html/Hits-class.html">Hits</a> objects produced by running <code><a href="../../DEXSeq/html/methods-gr.html">findOverlaps</a></code> 
between regions (as the query) and windows (as the subject).
Each set of windows overlapping a region is defined as a cluster to compute various statistics.
</p>
<p>A wrapper is necessary as a window may overlap multiple regions.
If so, the multiple instances of that window are defined as distinct &ldquo;overlapped&rdquo; windows, 
where each overlapped window is assigned to a different region.
Each overlapped window is represented by a separate entry of <code>overlaps</code>.
In contrast, the &ldquo;individual&rdquo; window just refers to the window itself, regardless of what it overlaps.
This is represented by each row of the <a href="../../SummarizedExperiment/html/RangedSummarizedExperiment-class.html">RangedSummarizedExperiment</a> object and the <code>tab</code> derived from it.
</p>
<p>The distinction between these two definitions is required to describe the weight arguments.
The <code>o.weights</code> argument refers to the weights for each region-window relationship.
This allows for different weights to be assigned to the same window in different regions.
The <code>i.weights</code> argument is the weight of the window itself, and is the same regardless of the region.
If both are specified, <code>o.weights</code> takes precedence.
</p>
<p>For <code>summitOverlaps</code>, the <code>region.best</code> argument is designed to accept the <code>rep.test</code> field in the output of <code>getBestOverlaps</code> (run with <code>by.pval=FALSE</code>).
This contains the index for the individual window that is the summit within each region.
In contrast, the <code>i.summit</code> argument indicates whether an individual window is a summit, e.g., from <code><a href="../../csaw/help/findMaxima.html">findMaxima</a></code>.
The <code>o.summit</code> argument does the same for overlapped windows, though this has no obvious input within the <code>csaw</code> pipeline.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>For <code>combineOverlaps</code>, <code>getBestOverlaps</code>, <code>empiricalOverlaps</code> and <code>mixedOverlaps</code>, 
a <a href="../../S4Vectors/html/DataFrame-class.html">DataFrame</a> is returned from their respective wrapped functions.
Each row of the DataFrame corresponds to a region, where regions without overlapped windows are assigned <code>NA</code> values.
</p>
<p>For <code>summitOverlaps</code>, a numeric vector of weights is produced.
This can be used as <code>o.weight</code> in the other two functions.
