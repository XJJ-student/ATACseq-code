<h3>Value</h3>

<p>For <code>clusterFDR</code>, a numeric scalar is returned as the cluster-level FDR.
</p>
<p>For <code>controlClusterFDR</code>, a list is returned containing two numeric scalars &ndash; <code>threshold</code>, the window-level FDR threshold to control the cluster-level FDR near <code>target</code>; and <code>FDR</code>, the estimate of the cluster-level FDR corresponding to <code>threshold</code>.
</p>


<h3>Definition of the cluster-level FDR</h3>

<p>The <code>clusterFDR</code> function computes an informal estimate of the cluster-level FDR, where each cluster is formed by aggregating only significant tests.
In the context of ChIP-seq, each significant test refers to a DB window that is detected at a FDR below <code>threshold</code>.
The idea is to obtain an error rate while reporting the precise coordinates of a DB subinterval in a complex region.
</p>
<p>This complements the standard pipeline based on <code><a href="../../csaw/help/combineTests.html">combineTests</a></code>, which defines regions independently of the DB status of the windows.
In a complex region, the precise coordinates of the DB subinterval cannot be reported.
Here, we overcome this by clustering directly on DB windows and applying post-hoc control of the cluster-level FDR.
See <code><a href="../../csaw/help/clusterWindows.html">clusterWindows</a></code> for more details.
</p>
<p>The cluster-level FDR is defined as the proportion of reported clusters that have no true positives.
Simply using <code>threshold</code> on the window-level adjusted p-values is not sufficient to control this, as the cluster- and window-level FDRs are not equivalent. 
Instead, the observed number of false positive tests is estimated based on <code>threshold</code> and the total number of significant tests, 
and a conservative estimate for the number of false positive clusters (where all tests are true nulls) is computed.
</p>
<p>However, note that the calculation of the cluster-level FDR here is not statistically rigorous.
This is not guaranteed to be an upper bound, especially with few or correlated tests. 
Thus, users should use the standard <code><a href="../../csaw/help/combineTests.html">combineTests</a></code>-based pipeline wherever possible.
Clustering on significant windows should only be performed where the precise coordinates of the DB subinterval are important for interpretation.
</p>


<h3>Searching for the best threshold</h3>

<p><code>controlClusterFDR</code> will identify the window-level FDR threshold required to control the cluster-level FDR at <code>target</code>.
The former is not a simple function of the latter (neither continuous nor guaranteed to be monotonic), so a grid search is used.
Clusters of significant windows are identified at each window-level threshold, and the corresponding cluster-level FDR is computed with <code>clusterFDR</code>.
</p>
<p>The grid is initially defined with <code>grid.length</code> equally spaced points in <code>[0, target]</code>.
At each iteration, the grid points with cluster-level FDRs above and below <code>target</code> are chosen, and the grid is redefined within that interval.
This is repeated for <code>iterations</code> iterations, and the largest window-level threshold that achieves a cluster-level FDR below <code>target</code> is chosen.
</p>
<p>The <code>FUN</code> argument should be a function that accepts a logical vector specifying significance, and returns an integer vector of cluster IDs.
If, for example, it accepts an input vector <code>ix</code>, then the output should contain cluster IDs corresponding to the entries of <code>which(ix)</code>.
This is because cluster IDs are only defined for significant tests, given that only those tests are used for clustering.
</p>
<p>A consequence of this search strategy is that the returned window-level FDR threshold will always be less than <code>target</code>.
In other words, each window should be significantly DB on its own merits (i.e., after controlling the window-level FDR) before it is placed into a cluster.
This protects against scenarios where very large thresholds yield low cluster-level FDRs, due to the formation of a few large clusters.
</p>


<h3>Note about weights</h3>

 
<p>In both functions, the <code>weights</code> argument is assumed to contain frequency weights of significant tests/windows.
For example, a weight of 2 for a test would be equivalent to repeating that test (i.e., repeating the same window so it shows up twice in your analysis).
These weights should be the same as those used during weighted FDR control to compute adjusted p-values.
In general, you should not set this argument unless you know what you're doing.
